## 2. Core Features & Usage Guide

### Student Profile Creation (CRITICAL)
Students **must** have a profile to start a session. This ensures the AI uses the correct age-appropriate tutor (K-2, 3-5, etc.).
- **How to:** Click "Student Switcher" (top right) > "Manage Profiles" > "Add Student".
- **Benefit:** Profiles track specific goals, pace, and previous session summaries.

### Homework & Document Uploads
The AI tutor performs best when it has context.
- **The Rule:** **Upload homework first.**
- **How to:** Dashboard > "Study Materials" > "Upload".
- **Pinning:** Students must "Pin" specific documents they want to discuss in the current session.

### Starting a Session
- **Step 1:** Select the Student Profile.
- **Step 2:** Choose the Subject (Math, English, Spanish).
- **Step 3:** Click "Start Tutor".
- **Interacting:** Students can speak naturally or type in the transcript box.

### Mic Permissions
- If voice isn't working, ensure the browser has permission to use the microphone.
- **Tip:** Look for the camera/mic icon in the browser address bar.

## 3. Anticipated Questions & Answers (FAQ)

**Q: The tutor isn't talking back to me.**
**A:** Ensure your volume is up and your microphone is enabled. Check the "Audio Settings" in the Settings page to verify the correct input/output devices are selected.

**Q: How do minutes work?**
**A:** We use a hybrid system. 
1. **Subscription Minutes:** Refresh every month. Use them or lose them.
2. **Rollover Minutes:** Purchased separately and never expire. They are used only after your monthly minutes are exhausted.

**Q: Can my two kids use the same account?**
**A:** Yes! Create two separate student profiles. The AI will switch its personality and difficulty level instantly based on who is selected.

**Q: Why did the tutor stop the session?**
**A:** You may have run out of minutes. You can purchase a "Top-Up" instantly in the tutor interface to continue.

**Q: Is the content safe for my child?**
**A:** Yes. We have a multi-layered moderation system that filters non-educational content and ensures a safe learning environment.

## 4. Agent Best Practices
- **Empathy First:** Education can be frustrating. Acknowledge the student's effort.
- **Check Profiles:** Always check if a student profile is selected if they report "it's not starting."
- **Homework Reminder:** If the AI seems "generic," remind the parent to upload the specific assignment instructions.
